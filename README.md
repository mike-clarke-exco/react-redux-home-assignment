This repo contains a basic React app with a table component listing some mock work logs. 
The data is given in the `data.js` file, do not modify it.
The table already implements draggable rows using a 3rd party library called [react-sortable-hoc](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc).

Use the example provided to you to build the following React.js app:

- The app should have a responsive table which looks like the design above 
- Both columns and rows should be draggable
- Manage your app state using Redux
- Add an icons library of your choice
- Try to write clean code using good client architecture

Once done with all of that, some extra things you can add:
- Add pretty CSS like fonts, cursor and hover states
- Make the table also look good in mobile view

Notice that this example has some mistakes you will need to fix, including but not limited to: console warning, missing .gitignore, etc...
